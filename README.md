# Colltaz Conjuture Public Encryption Algorthim(CCPEA)
This is a fun project i wanted to do to expand on my skills for computer programming.
# DISCLAMER
This algorithm is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used for actual encryption as it does not meet industry standards for security. The Collatz Conjecture, on which the encryption is based, is not proven to be true or false and therefore its use in encryption is unreliable. Additionally, the algorithm uses randomly generated private keys, making it easy for a determined attacker to decrypt the message. This algorithm should not be used to protect sensitive information and its use is at the user's own risk.
