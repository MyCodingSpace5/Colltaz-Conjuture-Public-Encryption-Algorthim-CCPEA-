# Colltaz Conjuture Public Encryption Algorthim(CCPEA)
A encryption algorthim based on 3x+1
# DISCLAMER
This algorithm is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used for actual encryption as it does not meet industry standards for security. The Collatz Conjecture, on which the encryption is based, is not proven to be true or false and therefore its use in encryption is unreliable. Additionally, the algorithm uses randomly generated private keys, making it easy for a determined attacker to decrypt the message. This algorithm should not be used to protect sensitive information and its use is at the user's own risk.
# DISCLAMER 2:
By going past this disclamer, You here by agree to all of the terms between you and MyCodingSpace5 said above, You here by requlish your rights to hold him accountable in a court of law or a court of justice, Because as I said in the disclamer, This is only for demonstrational purposes only and should not be used to encrypt sensetive personal infromation.
# How it works
A random colltaz conjuture is generated via a random number generator, This seqeuence has a length, It uses the length propterty to randomly generate numbers that could be used as private keys
